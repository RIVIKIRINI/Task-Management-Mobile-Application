# Task Management Mobile Application
My task management app built with Android Studio and Kotlin is designed to efficiently manage your daily tasks.
1. Task Creation: Users can easily add tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, etc. This 
information is stored in a SQLite database.
2. Task Listing: The app provides a clear view of all tasks in a list format, showing essential details like title, due 
date, and priority level. Tasks can be sorted based on different criteria like due date or priority.
3. Task Editing: Users can edit existing tasks, updating details like title, description, due date, or priority level 
directly from the task details screen.
4. Task Deletion: Tasks can be deleted either individually or through a batch selection mode, allowing users to 
remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
5. Database Management: Utilizes SQLite database for efficient storage and retrieval of task data. This ensures 
data persistence across app sessions.
6. User Interface: Implements a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation between task creation, task list, 
and task details screens. The design adheres to Android's Material Design guidelines for a cohesive and 
polished look
